# CropDiseaseDetection-Project
To identify plant diseases from images. Enhances agricultural practices by enabling timely diagnosis and treatment, boosting crop yield and sustainability.

OBJECTIVE :
A complex IOT environment of crop diseases and insect pests identification model is established.
Through the deployment of  sensors and cameras in the complex mountainous environment, the environmental information and image information of the scene are collected, and the basic database of crop pest identification is established
Through the deep learning network model, the image information is learned and recognized which is used to identify and collect leaft image , and the identfy pests and diseases

ABSTRACT :
Agricultural diseases and insect pests are of the most important factors that seriously threaten agricultural production.
Early detection and identification of pests can effectively reduce the economic losses caused by the pests.
In this project, convolution neural network is used to automatically identify crop diseases.
